<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there my name is Subham Soni, I am a sophomore at the Institute of Engineering & Managament.
  Recently I have completed my Freshman year with a Cgpa of 9.01. I have been working on quite a few skills 
  whilst I am on my summer break like web dev and DSA.
  I have also recently been interested in UI/UX design and graphics related fields
  which I would like to explore more of.
  I am also interested and excited about AI and ML which are the evolving and trendy fields of the day.
